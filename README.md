# NBA-Detail-data-analysis
In this project, my team and I will do a detail analysis based on the NBA dataset on Kaggle. We also have a version of Google data studio to present the information that we found.

**The final work** here is the link to the Google Data Studio:

## [ 1. OVERVIEW ](/9lRMLcbMR--joBvR84z5KA)

[ **- About the data**: ](/9lRMLcbMR--joBvR84z5KA) 

- This NBA dataset contain many information both about the seasons and the players information. The pros of having quite large data at hand is that I can do deep dive data anaylis and found good and well-rounded insights.
- Data is stored in 3 seperate csv file which are player_data, player and seasons_stats

[ **-  What are we going to do with the dataset?**: ](/9lRMLcbMR--joBvR84z5KA) 
1. **The purpose**: before starting to analyze any dataset, we must know what kind of information and insights that we are looking for. By doing so, we choose imaging that we are data scientists of an NBA talent agency. Our task is to look for and provide useful insights for our agency to hunt and improve the performance of our talents.

## [ 2. THE APPROACH ](/9lRMLcbMR--joBvR84z5KA)

### [2.1 Code approach](/lH2ryznwTJa4oKA092dkkA)
- There are 2 main coding parts: I will not go detail for the coding part here. You can check the jupyter notebook.

| Cleaning code | Vsualization code | 
| -------- | -------- | -------- |


#### [2.1.2 Little bit about the Insighs](/lH2ryznwTJa4oKA092dkkA)

## [3. Conclusion ](/-iz_-FrPQ3SPbl7WJxdocg)

**There are main insights that we would like to highlight in our dataset:**
1. **The number of players** has increased significantly while the number of team is not increased that much ==> each NBA teams has more no of players, however the number of official players in each game maintain the same ==> it's more and more competitive to have an official slot in an NBA games since more and more talents want to join this industry.


2. **Avg career length** is 7 years and almost 50% could not pass the first 3 years, however we can see many outliers example in this industry with one stayed in NBA for 22 years.


3. **Top players** have the tendency to be on top for more than 2 times, with the record of Micheal Jordan being the most effective player in term of scoring for 10 seasons.


4. **Top players age** in range 20-30, most be on top not long after their first NBA season.


5. At a glance, we can see that the **height and weight** of nba players is distributed normally. Most of players is within range [180,210] for Height and [80,100] for weight.


6. In term of strategy, players are shooting more and more **3-pointer**. However, shooting more doesn't mean players get more effecience at this.
